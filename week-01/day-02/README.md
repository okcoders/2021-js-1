### 

- Excercise: new folder, open in vs code, new html file, script tag, console.log("hello world"), live server, open the console to see the output

### High Level Concepts

- execution order of the file
    vars, undefined
- line execution order
    var a = 1 
    var b = 2
    var c = 3
    c = a + b + c
- operators
    + - / * && || > < ===
- operands
    values on left and right of operators
- properties and methods
    built ins on data types


### Free code camp notes

- if I change a now, is b changed in some way?

- if you though the i++ thing was weird don't worry

- Math.floor

- nobody does the multiplication version

- I missed the period

- length property is a common big thing

- the 0 index thing will throw you off for a long time

- order of operations, or order of how things are evaluated on a line: var thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
