### Excercise 

- new folder, open in vscode, new html file, open in live server
- new js file
- link the js file to the html file
- add button that says "add pet"
- in your js file, document.getElementById that button
- add inputs for name, email, and address
- document.getElementById those new inputs

### Branching and Conditionals!

- truthy and falsy (how do non-booleans turn into bools, !!)
- pretty much always use strict

### Homework

- skip switches!
- up to record collection
